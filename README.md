# A Blockchain-Based Trusted Management Framework for IoT Collaboration

## Abstract
Essentially, the property of IoT applications is the ability to perform tasks through the collaboration of IoT devices and entities. However, security threats from both devices and entities severely hinder reliable IoT collaboration. Uncertified IoT entities may trick devices into launching illegal tasks. The adversaries can intercept the transmitted data and then modify it or forward it to an intended receiver. Besides, the traditional centralized storage system is no longer suitable for IoT due to scalability, reliability, and privacy issues. Unfortunately, most current works focus on one of the above problems and lack a holistic approach. This paper proposes a holistic trusted management framework for IoT collaboration. We design a lightweight authentication and key negotiation mechanism to ensure the reliable initialization of IoT collaboration. Besides, edge computing is introduced to enable secure and distributed data storage. We propose a fine-grained access control mechanism to avoid unauthorized data sharing. Blockchain is deployed as a decentralized trusted protocol execution environment. The experimental evaluation and security analysis prove the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework.
